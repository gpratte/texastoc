	Chopping points or money works the same way. An example should be explanation enough.
	<h2>1st and 2nd place chop</h2>
	Assume the following:
	<ul>
	<li>1st place has 75,000 chips
	<li>2nd place has 25,000 chips
	<li>1st place points (or money) is 67
	<li>1st place points (or money) is 33
	</ul>
	So 1st place is 75%, 2nd place is 25% and the total points (money) is 100.
	<br>
	What <b>not to do</b> is add together the points (money) and apply the percentages 
	(i.e. 1st place gets 75 points (money) and 2nd place gets 25 points (money).
	<br>
	<br>
	The way is works is to give both players 2nd place points (money) and then apply the
	percentages to what is left over.
	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>1st place gets 2nd place points (money) = 33
	<li>2nd place gets 2nd place points (money) = 33
	<li>That leaves 34 points left to chop
	<li>1st place gets another 34 * .75 = 25.5
	<li>2nd place gets another 34 * .25 = 8.5
	<li>1st place gets a total of 58.5 (33 + 25.5)
	<li>2nd place gets a total of 41.5 (33 + 8.5)
	</ol>
	<h2>1st, 2nd and 3rd place chop</h2>
	In this case all three get 3rd place points (money) and the rest is chopped.
