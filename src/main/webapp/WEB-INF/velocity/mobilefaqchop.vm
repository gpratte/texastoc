	<div role="main" class="ui-content">
	Chopping points or money works the same way. An example should be explanation enough.
	<h2>1st and 2nd place chop</h2>
	Assume the following:
	<ul>
	<li>1st place has 75,000 chips
	<li>2nd place has 25,000 chips
	<li>1st place points (or money) is 67
	<li>1st place points (or money) is 33
	</ul>
	So 1st place is 75%, 2nd place is 25% and the total points (money) is 100.
	<br>
	What <b>not to do</b> is add together the points (money) and apply the percentages 
	(i.e. 1st place gets 75 points (money) and 2nd place gets 25 points (money).
	<br>
	<br>
	The way is works is to give both players 2nd place points (money) and then apply the
	percentages to what is left over.
	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>1st place gets 2nd place points (money) = 33
	<li>2nd place gets 2nd place points (money) = 33
	<li>That leaves 34 points left to chop
	<li>1st place gets another 34 * .75 = 25.5
	<li>2nd place gets another 34 * .25 = 8.5
	<li>1st place gets a total of 58.5 (33 + 25.5)
	<li>2nd place gets a total of 41.5 (33 + 8.5)
	</ol>
	<h2>1st, 2nd and 3rd place chop</h2>
	In this case all three get 3rd place points (money) and the rest is chopped.
	<h2>Is there a ceiling on 1st place?</h2>
	Yes. The algorithm prevents 1st place from getting more than 1st place points. 
	For example if 1st place is 100 points with no chop then
	1st place cannot get more than 100 points if there is a chop.
